          <h4>PIC3</h4>
          <p>I've created a new workflow, called PIC3, for our field specialists to streamline their work. This is accomplished based on a combination of new roles and responsibilities they are assigned with in addition to the state that the item is currently in. The previous admin site allowed full access to all fields by all administrators, even if they should not have access to them. One of the goals was to keep the front end simple and straight-forward since this is an internal app to ease upgrade paths in the future, yet easy enough to use with the necessary functionality provided to the field specialists.  </p>

          <h4>Inbox</h4>
          <p>All specialists see a personalized inbox when they log in to PIC3. On the left, they see a list of all items for all sales that are assigned to them to work on. On the right is a color-coded chart of the percentage of item state per sale.     </p>

          <h4>New Item</h4>
          <p>When creating a new item, it will be placed in the tagging state. Mostly a plain old form page, the thing to notice is how the specialist picks the multi-nested category which dynamically exposes the associated properties and variants. In an earlier project I completed, I normalized and imported over 450,000 nodes of data for categories, properties, and variants. We want to keep the organizer focused on tagging items as quickly as possible so photographers and catalogers can work simultaneously in the upcoming steps. </p>

          <h4>Project Managers sale page</h4>
          <p>Project managers wanted a quick way to see overall progress for a sale. After several iterations of varying success, project managers and I collaborated to end up with a customized chart that shows the percent complete by number of items.  Below it is your typical listing of items with search, sort, and pagination.</p>

          <h4>Alerts and Comments</h4>
          <p>Specialists can add comments to items while they're being processed.  A common complaint was that it was easy to lose track of the conversation since everyone was working on so many items at once.  I implemented a simple badge notification and commenting system to match the mental model that is used in many sites and applications people are used to. </p>
