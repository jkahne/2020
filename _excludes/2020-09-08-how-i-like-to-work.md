Someone has an idea for a product. 
Whole team ( 2 devs and a designer ) speak with them, and any other stakeholders. 
    Introductions
    Vacation picture  
Story map
    Cards are NOT “same sized”
    Now have a matrix of important affordances for users for the breadth of the app.
Roadmap => draw a line horizontally across the story map.  Only the most important things are moved above the line. 
    Want to plan out the next release? Draw another line below the first and do the same. 
Create a kanban board.
