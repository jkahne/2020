I work best with small teams and I care about producing the best software. To me, that means more than simply checking off items on the todo list. That's the type of service that is all too prevalent in this industry. I like producing solid code that is designed for your users in mind.  If the end product isn't usable, friendly, and stable then it isn't finished.  

I like working with end users to discuss what they truly want and need out of their systems and keeping everyone in the loop on the progress of the work. Constant communication and feedback are essential in producing successful software.

Seeks to build a lasting relationship that results in rewarding outcomes.

My expertise is available for hire.

In consulting I aim to help companies learn not just what the correct design choices are, but why it’s so. I help people deliver value with software that is elegant, consistent, and fast.

I accomplish this with deep experience in all areas of technology. My work goes as deep as writing device drivers in assembly and as high as building rock-solid single-page-apps in JavaScript; as serious as large-scale release automation for mission-critical applications and as unserious as deep OpenGL work for video games. An understanding of the entire technology ecosystem is extremely effective for finding efficient and novel solutions to your problems.

Clients work with me because:

When it’s crunch time they can’t afford to iterate on bad designs, and rely on me to have the foresight to judge problems and the skill to quickly execute on their solutions. They trust me to design systems, write code, allocate resources, lead teams, and deliver.
They want someone who understands more than their niche. Novel approaches can be the edge you need, and those come from people with broad experience to draw from. Having worked on software from the top to the bottom, I easily pull solutions from across domains to solve problems.
