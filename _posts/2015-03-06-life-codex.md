If I boiled my thoughts and beliefs down to a list, this is as close as I can come. Some of these are my own while others were found on the internet and they resonated with me. I'm sorry for not properly giving credit where due, but would be happy to do so.  I'm sure I'll edit this along the way - afterall, life is a WIP. Let's see where this goes.


---------------
1. You create your own life purpose
1. If you don't like where you're at, take a step in any direction.
1. Embrace the highs, lows, and the chaos in-between.
1. Take care of yourself with good food, sleep, and exercise. You can make your life much better through incremental improvement
1. Non-attachment to results.
  - There are 3 versions of you - the Past You, the Present You, and the Future You.
  - Thank the Past You, Fuck the Present You, Think of the Future You.
1. Forgive yourself. This doesn't give you permission to be a jerk.
1. Read.
1. Energetically let go of comparing, competing, judgements, anger, regrets, worrying, blame, guilt, and fear.  Laugh at your yourself when you can't.
1. Balance in all things.
1. Thoughtfulness and openness.
1. Personal Responsibility.
1. Do not put value on material things. If there’s a question about if it’s necessary, remove it.
1. See what you can get away with.
1. Stir the pot for fun, but be obvious about it.
1. The quality of your friends always matters more than the quantity.
1. Always provide correction in private and praise in public.
1. Opening the door for a lady is not optional.
1. Good fences make good neighbors. Be selective who to let in.
1. He who angers you conquers you.
1. Understand that you have blind spots
1. Understand their perspective.
1. Run your own race.
1. Focus and do one thing at a time.
1. Shorten feedback loops.
1. Adapting to change is more important than predicting change. Despite claims, you can't predict the unpredictable.
1. Remove bottlenecks.
1. Find satisfaction in your job. Find happiness in your life.
