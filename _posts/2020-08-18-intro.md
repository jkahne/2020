Hello internet people! 👋

I’m Jeremy. This site is very much a work in process, hence the “unpolished” look of it. I don’t know what I want to put on here, who my audience is, or who they should be. That’s assuming I even get an audience!

I came across [this](https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more) and it resonated with me, particularly the first bit where Joel talks about a “blog” not being a “content marketing strategy” or a place to build a “personal brand”. Others may stumble across this site and think that that’s what I’m trying to do, but that’s fine. That’s not my intention for putting anything on here.  


### What are my intentions? 

This is me kicking myself into writers mode. I aim to get better at organizing my thoughts in written word and stories. I need to lose my self-censoring instinct and put what I think and believe out there, and this should help. I want to get my ideas out there, get feedback, and learn. Growth comes from being uncomfortable so I want to expose my weaknesses and insecurities. 

### What am I concerned about? 

I don’t consider myself a good writer. I feel like I need to write and edit for much longer than others. That said, I’m using this as a brain dump and I don’t want to do much editing here.  At least for now.  

I definitely suffer from imposters syndrome ( with respect to work ) and feel like I have nothing new to add to the topics I like.  I will expose my ignorance on a lot of things and that’s something I typically don’t like doing.  I need to get over that. 


### So What Do You Do? What Will You Put on Here?

The simple answer is: I’m a developer, consultant, development manager, and team lead.  I’ve lead agile transformations and was a CTO for 4 years. I have strong opinions on process and methodology, teamwork, how we treat each other, psychologically safety, nonviolent  communication, feedback, decision making, management, and leadership. These things, the “glue” of a good team, is what I’m interested in.  Much more so than code.  I want to say you can find code examples elsewhere, but I may end up putting some here. 🤷‍♂️

My background is kinda all over the place in terms of titles/roles.  I started in Java land with a bunch of SQL, transitioned to Ruby on Rails for a long time, sprinkle in some React, and now doing some Elixir & Phoenix. Add in some product management, mentoring, consulting, and setting strategy and that’s my story.

I've been leading and delivering projects for 20 years under various titles across multiple markets. I’ve been an eXtreme Programming practitioner and advocate since 2000.  The values and principles from the XP community have greatly influenced my approach to projects and guiding teams to success. 

I’m sure I’ll get into the meat of all those things over time. We’ll see how this experiment goes.  Stay tuned.
