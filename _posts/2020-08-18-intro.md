## Consultant | Dev Manager | Team Lead | Developer

I've been leading and delivering projects for 20 years under various titles across multiple markets. An agile practitioner and advocate since 2000, the values and principles have greatly influenced my approach to managing projects and leading teams to success.


## these
Listening and understanding
seeing the whole picture
collaboration
transparency
short feedback loops
open communication
system thinking
"boring" stable technologies


## over these
feature factory
work without context
"shiny" new technologies





I care more about providing my customers with software that they need over what a document says they need. I like to take a step back and see the full picture so that I'm in a position to connect the dots between disparate teams and work flows. I like working with end users to discuss what they truly need out of their systems and keeping everyone in the loop on the progress of the work. Constant communication and feedback are vitally necessary in producing successful software.

My background is kinda all over the place in terms of titles/roles.  I started in Java land with a bunch of SQL, transitioned to Ruby on Rails for a long time, and now doing some Elixir & Phoenix.  Sprinkle in React, add some people and product management in there as well as consulting, and that's my story.
