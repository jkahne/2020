Nimble River consults on Ruby on Rails, evangelizes Kanban boards and lean    methods, and gets your application and processes under control with the results you want.  Whether you  need a prototype, team augmentation, or an application rescued from technical debt, say hi at hello@    nimbleriver.com and let's chat about your needs.


We may currently prefer the Ruby on Rails stack, but we can do much more.  It all depends on    what you need.  We have more than 30 years of combined experience developing software in many languages and environments.  The Nimble River team has development experience in higher education, energy         management, telecommunications, military, banking, retail, infrastructure management,  billing,         insurance, mortgage, legal, and manufacturing. Contact us if you want to work with seasoned             professionals to produce your solution.

We don't want to be just another hired gun for you.  We want our relationship to be built on    solid communication and trust.  To facilitate this, we need to learn to work together to avoid the      typical miscommunication between businesses and consultancies  that end in panic. This can be avoided   by following a few simple to understand principals. These principals will also allow you to remove      process bottlenecks, align teams, and better see the stream of value produced by our collective team.

The Nimble River team has a history of upgrading out-of-date applications, smashing monolithic  apps apart into a well-defined SOA architectures, and stabalizing applications from crashing daily.     Whether you want to convert a legacy app to a modern stack or standardize your various environments, we can do that too. Informed decision making and careful refactorings will get your project back on track.
